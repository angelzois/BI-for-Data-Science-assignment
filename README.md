# Project Overview:
This project is focused on implementing Business Intelligence (BI) solutions for a supermarket chain, specifically utilizing data warehousing (DW), OLTP systems, and ETL transformations. The goal is to analyze sales data, create schemas, and transform data to support decision-making processes.
It was a group assignment and the contributors can be found in the main document. 

## Contents of the Zip File:
 OLTP and DW Schemas:

OLTP_schema.mwb: MySQL Workbench file containing the schema design for the OLTP database.
DW_schema.mwb: MySQL Workbench file containing the schema design for the Data Warehouse.
Data File:

supermarket_sales - Sheet1.csv: CSV file containing the sales data from the supermarket.
SQL and ETL Scripts:

step7.sql: SQL script related to the implementation or querying of the data warehouse.
Time_transformation.ktr: ETL transformation script for time-related data.
Transformation 2.ktr: ETL transformation script for a specific part of the data.
Transformation 3.ktr: Another ETL transformation script for a different part of the data.
Report:

Group Assignment-Group11-BI 24.docx: Document containing the group assignment, detailing the project approach, methodologies, and results.
Pentaho Report:

Step_8.prpt: Pentaho report file generated from the BI analysis.

Instructions for Use:
OLTP and DW Schemas:

Open the .mwb files in MySQL Workbench to view and edit the OLTP and DW schemas.
Data File:

The supermarket_sales - Sheet1.csv file contains the sales data. This data can be imported into the OLTP database for further processing.
SQL and ETL Scripts:

Use the step7.sql script to run necessary SQL commands.
The .ktr files are ETL scripts that can be opened with Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle) for running data transformations.
Report:

The document Group Assignment-Group11-BI 24.docx provides detailed information about the project and should be referred to for understanding the project scope and results.
Pentaho Report:

The Step_8.prpt file can be opened in Pentaho Report Designer to view or modify the report generated.
Screenshots:

Review the screenshots in the Screenshots folder for a visual understanding of the schemas, transformations, and data tables used in the project.
## Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive approach to BI for a supermarket chain, from data collection and transformation to schema design and reporting. Utilize the provided resources for a complete understanding and replication of the project's objectives and outcomes.
